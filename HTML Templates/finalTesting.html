                    Our work has an in-built machine learning model that classifies the contents of a webpage as Safe or Not safe for work (NSFW) by using techniques such as image classification and sentiment analysis. NSFW content is anything that is deemed to be inappropriate in a public or professional setting, including age-restricted content. The end product of the our work is a cross-browser web extension that can detect and classify content as safe or NSFW in real time and be able to remove or redact the said content from the web pages displayed in the client's browser. A web extension would be a universal and easy-to-use solution for the user to protect themselves from sensitive content on the internet. Thus, the work intends to solve the problem of censorship of sensitive content on the internet.

        You can’t. You need other words, like pronouns, to be the object of the sentence. If you say “fuck,” for example, you need “him” or “you” or “it” to tell us whom, or what, should be metaphorically fucked. You can issue the command “Fuck shit up,” but you still need “up” as the adverbial particle. In Glaswegian Scots, “fook” is a place you can “get tae” (the complete sentence, “Get tae fook,” means “Please depart immediately, or possible harm to your person may ensue”). But you still need those other little words in the sentence.
        Of course, if you are Samuel L. Jackson, “motherfucker” is a complete sentence. The Star Wars prequels become 300% more bearable if you add that fine word to the end of his dialogue:
        “This party’s over, motherfucker.” (Episode II, to Count Dooku)
        “I don’t think so, motherfucker.” (same scene)
        “You’re under arrest, motherfucker.” (Episode III, to Chancellor Palpatine)

        You are a retard. I hate you. I hate the fact you exist. You are scum. You are an absolute fucking douchebag. You are a lowlife piece of human garbage. You absolute fucking retard cunt. You are a waste of a human being. You've done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that's important. You dumb cunt, you piece of shit. You're not even a son of a bitch, that's too dignified a term for what you are. You know, you're not even human. You don't deserve the word human because you are that much of a fucking disgrace to people all around the globe, worldwide. It's a dishonor to put you in the same sentence with that word, you asshole. Are you fucking proud of yourself? Are you proud of having accomplished absolutely nothing in your life? You have only done bad things in this world. You do not deserve to live, you shit. You are a terrible excuse for a human being. You are an ABSOLUTE cunt. You are nothing but a faggot brainlet. You sleazy two-faced bastard. You slimy sluggish asshole. You TRIFLING motherfucker.

                The Internet was the biggest invention of the 20th century. The Internet grew from a closed network of a few universities to the biggest telecommunications network in the world. The Internet today is populated by billions of computers. The sudden growth and scale of the internet make it impossible to have a central authority to control what content is being posted on the internet. Internet companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have community guidelines for policing the content uploaded to their site. However, this is only restricted to their respective platforms and the internet is much wider. While other forms of media like television, print, film, and music have advisory councils and a clearly defined system for censorship, there is a vacuum in the tech world in the protection of users on the internet from being exposed to sensitive content. There is little to no censorship of sensitive content on the internet and the crux of this work is to find a solution to solve this very problem. The work intends to leverage the recent advancements in the field of machine learning and deep learning and the past literature on this matter to design a system for the real-time censorship of content on the internet. The work proposes to build a machine learning model that will classify the contents of a webpage and classify them as Safe or Not safe for work (NSFW) by using techniques such as image classification and sentiment analysis. NSFW content is anything that is deemed to be inappropriate in a public or professional setting, including age-restricted content. The end product of the proposed work would be a cross-browser web extension that can detect and classify content as safe or NSFW in real time and be able to remove or redact the said content from the web pages displayed in the client’s browser. A web extension would be a universal and easy-to-use solution for the user to protect themselves from sensitive content on the internet. Thus, the work intends to solve the problem of censorship of sensitive content on the internet.
