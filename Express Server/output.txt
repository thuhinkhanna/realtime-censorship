Well patient zero means she didn't catch it from someone else, it means she's an original source. So the original meaning of patient zero still applies.

I once sent a dick pic to ~100 women using the tinder moments feature they had for a while. 10 unmatched me. 60 ignored me. Most thought I was crazy. I had sex with two women in the next 2-3 days from it. So, if you can have sex from sending ~50 dick pics, which takes 20 minutes... Guys will do it. Tldr: dick pics worn on 1-2% of women.
