                    Our work has an in-built machine learning model that classifies the contents of a webpage as Safe or Not safe for work (NSFW) by using techniques such as image classification and sentiment analysis. NSFW content is anything that is deemed to be inappropriate in a public or professional setting, including age-restricted content. The end product of the our work is a cross-browser web extension that can detect and classify content as safe or NSFW in real time and be able to remove or redact the said content from the web pages displayed in the client's browser. A web extension would be a universal and easy-to-use solution for the user to protect themselves from sensitive content on the internet. Thus, the work intends to solve the problem of censorship of sensitive content on the internet.

                    <p>
                        The dataset used for this project’s textual content has been gathered from various sources. A corpus of over 1000 swear words in the English language have been gathered and built from scratch which was used on top of the dataset. The main dataset that has been used for Multi-label classification is from the dataset provided by Jigsaw Conversation on Kaggle. <br> <br>
                        The dataset comprises of 38000 comments gathered from Wikipedia which have been manually labeled by human raters for toxic behavior and is classified into the following categories namely “toxic” , “obscene” , “insult” , “severe_toxic”, “identity_hate” and “threat”

            <div class="p-4">
                <b>Toxic</b> - A nasty, disrespectful, or irrational comment is referred to as toxic if it is likely to cause other users to quit the conversation. <br>
                For example : <span>Bye do not look come or think of comming back bitch</span> <br>
                <br>
                
                <b>Obscene</b> - A statement that violates accepted moral norms is typically referred to as obscene. It can be used to describe any verbal, literary, or visual works or behavior that depicts sex in an offensive, obscene, or lascivious way. Comments that are obscene can also be insulting, impolite, or disturbing. <br>
                For example : <span>Dick sucker before you piss around on my work</span> <br>
                <br>

                <b>Insult</b> - An insult is a crude or offensive statement or behavior that may or may not be true. Additionally, it could be an instance of arrogant or disrespectful language or behavior. Insults can range in content and context, and they can be used intentionally to hurt or offend someone. <br>
                For example : <span>Stupid peace of shit stop deleting my stuff</span> <br>
                <br>

                <b>Identity Hate</b> - A form of hate speech known as an identity hate comment attacks a person or group based on one or more of their actual or perceived identity characteristics, such as religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, descent, gender, language, economic or social background, handicap, health condition, or sexual orientation. It can be communicated through any form of expression and might be disparaging or biased towards a person or group of people. <br>
                For example : <span>A pair of jew hating nazi schmucks</span> <br>
                <br>

                <b>Severe Toxic</b> - This type of comments are nearly the same as toxic but are more severe and attacks the person's identity. <br>
                For example : <span>What a motherfucking piece of crap those fuckers are</span> <br>
                <br>

                <b>Threat</b> - A threat remark is a declaration that someone will suffer harm or unfavorable effects, frequently as a means of pressuring them to do or not do something. It may entail a threat to harm someone bodily as retaliation for something they have done or might do. <br>
                For example : <span>Fuck you smith please have me notified when you reach.</span>

                        The dataset used for this project's image content has been gathered from various sources. The main source for the NSFW images have been from Alex Kim's github repository which contains a rough estimate of around 500 gb of various NSFW images each labelled under 5 categories namely, <br> 
                        &nbsp; ◉ porn - Contains Pornographic Images. <br>
                        &nbsp; ◉ hentai - Contains Hentai Images. <br>
                        &nbsp; ◉ sexy - Contains sexually explicit images, but not pornography. <br>
                        &nbsp; ◉ neutral - safe for work neutral images of everyday things and people. <br>
                        &nbsp; ◉ drawings - safe for work drawings (including anime). <br> <br>
                        A shell-script has been created to download all the URLs provided in the repository to store the images in the local system separated by directories with the names of the label.

                <div style="text-align:justify;">
                    You can’t. You need other words, like pronouns, to be the object of the sentence. <p style="display:inline">If you say “fuck,” for example, you need “him” or “you” or “it” to tell us whom, or what, should be metaphorically fucked. You can issue the command “Fuck shit up,” but you still need “up” as the adverbial particle.</p> In Glaswegian Scots, “fook” is a place you can “get tae” (the complete sentence, “Get tae fook,” means “Please depart immediately, or possible harm to your person may ensue”). But you still need those other little words in the sentence. <p style="display:inline">Of course, if you are Samuel L. Jackson, motherfucker is a complete sentence.</p> The Star Wars prequels become 300% more bearable if you add that fine word to the end of his dialogue: <p style="display:inline">

                The Internet was the biggest invention of the 20th century. The Internet grew from a closed network of a few universities to the biggest telecommunications network in the world. The Internet today is populated by billions of computers. The sudden growth and scale of the internet make it impossible to have a central authority to control what content is being posted on the internet. Internet companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have community guidelines for policing the content uploaded to their site. However, this is only restricted to their respective platforms and the internet is much wider. While other forms of media like television, print, film, and music have advisory councils and a clearly defined system for censorship, there is a vacuum in the tech world in the protection of users on the internet from being exposed to sensitive content. There is little to no censorship of sensitive content on the internet and the crux of this work is to find a solution to solve this very problem. The work intends to leverage the recent advancements in the field of machine learning and deep learning and the past literature on this matter to design a system for the real-time censorship of content on the internet. The work proposes to build a machine learning model that will classify the contents of a webpage and classify them as Safe or Not safe for work (NSFW) by using techniques such as image classification and sentiment analysis. NSFW content is anything that is deemed to be inappropriate in a public or professional setting, including age-restricted content. The end product of the proposed work would be a cross-browser web extension that can detect and classify content as safe or NSFW in real time and be able to remove or redact the said content from the web pages displayed in the client’s browser. A web extension would be a universal and easy-to-use solution for the user to protect themselves from sensitive content on the internet. Thus, the work intends to solve the problem of censorship of sensitive content on the internet.
